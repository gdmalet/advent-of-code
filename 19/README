For Problem 2:

Unique atoms on LHS & RHS:

Al  Al
    Ar
B   B
    C
Ca  Ca
e
F   F
H   H
Mg  Mg
N   N
O   O
P   P
    Rn
Si  Si
Th  Th
Ti  Ti
    Y

e             is unique on the left
Ar, C, Rn, Y are unique on the right.

If Ar or Rn appears on the right, the pattern is always ^.Rn.+Ar$, where
^ is beginning of string, . is one symbol, .+ is one or more symbols,
$ is end of string.

A Y on the right is always between Rn and Ar, of the form Rn.Y.Ar or
Rn.Y.Y.Ar.

If a C appears on the right, it is always the first atom, and is always
followed by Rn.

Ignoring the last two, rules are:

atom => atom Rn mid Ar | atom [ atom ]
mid  => atom | atom Y atom | atom Y atom Y atom
e    => atom atom
